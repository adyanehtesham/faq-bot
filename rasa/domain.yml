  utter_IsorderingthroughSkiplysafe:
  - text: Our absolute priority is to offer the safest service possible to customers, riders and restaurants and we have taken a number of important actions to ensure we deliver food safely for everyone. For example, we have introduced contact-free delivery, guidelines for restaurants on how to run delivery-only kitchens hygienically and guidance for riders on safe and secure delivery. We are in daily contact with local health officials to make sure we are offering customers, restaurants and riders the most up-to-date guidance and safest service possible. It’s also important to note that the European Food Safety Authority has said that there is “no evidence that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus”. We realise this is a concerning period for everyone and want to assure you that safety is our priority during and beyond this unprecedented time
  utter_Howdoescontactfreedeliverywork:
  - text: Customers can choose ‘Contact-free delivery’ at check-out. Riders will be able to see when a customer has selected this option in the order’s delivery notes and will then follow a simple process to ensure there is no contact when the food is delivered. Riders will be asked to let the customer know they have arrived, place the order outside their door, step a safe distance back and wait nearby for the customer to collect the food before the order can be completed. Riders are also able to make orders contact-less if they wish by letting customers know through the app before they arrive.

  utter_WhatisSkiplyEditions:
  - text: There is! It’s available free on the App Store and Google Play.Skiply Editions
  utter_IfIorderfromarestaurant,howdoIknowifitsanEditionskitchen:
  - text: Skiply Editions are hubs where we host collections of hand-picked restaurants, all specially designed for delivery. They're how we make good on the promise that got Skiply started to connect you with great food from great restaurants, wherever you are, and whatever it takes. Skiply Editions are also a platform to support start-up restaurants, helping hot new chefs launch for the first time, or well-loved restaurants reach fans in new places.
  utter_WhatisEditionstryingtodo:
  - text: Editions kitchens are listed as separate restaurants on our platform - they are clearly labeled as being an Editions partner, and you can order on both the website and the app. When you order from a non-Editions restaurant, your meal will always come from that restaurant, not an Editions kitchen. Whether you chose to order from an Editions kitchen or not, you’ll always be delivered great food made locally.
  utter_HowdoesSkiplyEditionswork:
  - text: Since Skiply started, we've learned a lot about the restaurant industry and about you, our customers. Our restaurant partners have to spend up to a million pounds to launch a new restaurant in a city centre. From customers, we've learned you have really varied tastes – some of you order 10 different cuisines per month – and love the ability to explore exciting food from your homes.But when you put the two facts together, we realised that although restaurants want to reach people in residential areas, it's sometimes just not possible. Setting up a restaurant always includes a fair amount of risk. What if the location isn't right? Or how do you find the secret sauce to success, before the money runs out? Even some of the world's top rated chefs have described moments on Netflix's 'Chef's Table' when they thought they might have to close their doors.We wanted to help solve this. To connect our customers who want to eat great, exciting food without always travelling into the centre of a city, with the restaurants who want to reach them.Skiply Editions bridges this gap perfectly we bring brilliant food to people all over the world as well as provide the ability to help restaurants launch with zero start-up costs.
  utter_IsmymealdifferentwhenitcomesfromEditions:
  - text: We combine our customer insight, logistics experience and relationships with restaurants all over the world to bring an Edition to you.Using the technology that powers Skiply, we first identify an area that would most benefit from their own Editions hub. We then delve deeper into exactly what's missing from those local areas and what food our customers are craving.Once we know what's needed, we get to work, trying amazing dishes and partnering with the best restaurateurs in the business to fill the gap. That could be anyone from new chefs with great ideas, to high street favourites, as well as exclusive collaborations with the likes of Michelin-starred Karam Sethi. The choice is yours.Restaurants then design their kitchens hosted in a Skiply Edition. Given their delivery only nature, the chefs are focused solely on creating the ultimate home dining experience.The result? A community-tailored collection of restaurants, providing the gold standard of food delivery.
  utter_WhatisSkiplyPlus:
  - text: No. Editions kitchens use the same great chefs, ingredients and recipes to bring you the best food. With Editions you get the great food, cooked and prepared the way you love.Skiply Plus

  utter_IwassickafterconsumingfoodWhatdoIdo:
  - text: 1) Your full or partial refund was processed shortly after you have placed the order but is not appearing on your bank statement.If your refund was processed within 8 hours of placing your order, the payment will show as voided. This means you were never actually debited for your order. Instead, the funds for this transaction would have returned to general availability in your bank account after 72 hours.2) You can't see the full amount of your refund returned on your bank statement?If you've paid for your order partially with card and part credit, this might be the reason. Our refunds reflect the ratio of Skiply Credit to card payment that is used to place the original order. For example, If 50% of an order was paid for by credit, then 50% of any sized refund on that order will return to a customer's Skiply account as credit.
